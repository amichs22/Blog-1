<h1 id="top">1st Day Out</h>
<p>This is my first day learning how to code! I have only done like 4 modules on FFC, but so far I like it. LMAO, let's see how long I keep this same energy. </p>
</main>

<h2>Horsin' around with images and links</h>
<p>I actually quite like the <a target ="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.topgear.com%2Fcar-reviews%2Fdodge%2Fhellcat-2dr%2Ffirst-drive-0&psig=AOvVaw0jBYH-JJr1EeyEb75j81z2&ust=1629900463770000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCOip4sTqyfICFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD">newest Hellcat</a>. I think that it looks very nice.</p>
<a href="#Playboi-header">Jump to Playboi Carti</a>

<p>In case you didn't want to click that link, I will include a picture below.</p>

<h2 id="Playboi-header">Let's talk about Playboi Carti now</h2>
<p>The only reason that I have Hellcats on my mind right now is bc I've been listening to Carti's newest album. It's called Whole Lotta Red</p>

<h3>Let's see what this does now</h3>
<h4>My blog looks super disorganized bc I haven't really learned how to organize things nicely. Don't judge!</h4>
<h5>Anyway, time to get back on that grind</h5>
<p>Peace out!</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>
  <p>Haven't done much actual coding today. I have been working thru the introductions on Project Odin. That's taking me quite a while because I am trying to go through all of the addtional resources as best as I can. So far, that has included:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>additional readings</li>
    <li>listing to podcasts</li>
    <li>watching Youtube videos</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Wow! I am actually super excited right now. I couldn't understand why I was having a formatting issue everytime that I would look at the preview for this blog. I kept changing things that I thought might fix the issue, but those didn't work. I finally figured out that I didn't include a closing tag for my ordered list from the previous day. When I fixed that, it fixed my formatting issue right away! It's something small, but I am glad that I was able to look thru my code (even tho it's hella simple and primitive)and fix the issue by myself.</p>
  <p> I'm learning all about http right now. It was an additional resource available on Project Odin. It's actually really interesting to finally understand things that I use everyday like web page, web browser, http, network, internet, URL, etc... That being said, I have a headache trying to understand what I'm currently reading about http lmao. I'm currently reading about get and post requests. It's kind of a convuluted topic, but I am doing my best to understand it. Not sure how well I am doing with all of that, but I guess just showing up and showing initiative is half the battle.</p>
  
<h2>Day 4</h2>
  <p>Yesterday night I learned about the command line. It's super intimidating, and I feel like I don't remember a ton of things that I learned yesterday. However, I tried playing around with some of the commands that I learned yesterday, and I was quite surprised that I did remember quite a bit. Looking at it now, it seems like something I could learn. </p>
  <p>I have also been reading thru a short book on how the internet really works. It's kind of interesting, but it's very hard to read thru for me. I feel like I have to read every paragraph like 5 times to intake the information ugh. I also feel like I need to look up some term that I don't know every other sentence. I am naturally the type of person that likes to know everything single freaking detail when it comes to learning something new. I have been reading some forums that have said that it's more important to understand the concept than to try and memorize everything that I'm learning. I can see how that could be true. I am trying to internalize this, but I'm just so used to rote memorization. </p>
  <p> On a brighter note, here is a picture of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.davpetlovers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8917-1.jpg?v=1597127926" alt ="Cute puppy sticking its tongue out"> cute puppy.</a> </p>
