<h1>1st Day Out</h>
<p>This is my first day learning how to code! I have only done like 4 modules on FFC, but so far I like it. LMAO, let's see how long I keep this same energy. </p>

<h2>Horsin' around with images and links</h>
<p>I actually quite like the <a target ="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.topgear.com%2Fcar-reviews%2Fdodge%2Fhellcat-2dr%2Ffirst-drive-0&psig=AOvVaw0jBYH-JJr1EeyEb75j81z2&ust=1629900463770000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCOip4sTqyfICFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD">newest Hellcat</a>. I think that it looks very nice.</p>
<a href="Playboi-header">Jump to Playboi Carti</a>

<p>In case you didn't want to click that link, I will include a picture below.</p>

<h2 id="Playboi-header">Let's talk about Playboi Carti now</h2>
<p>The only reason that I have Hellcats on my mind right now is bc I've been listening to Carti's newest album. It's called Whole Lotta Red</p>

<h3>Let's see what this does now</h3>
<h4>My blog looks super disorganized bc I haven't really learned how to organize things nicely. Don't judge!</h4>
<h5>Anyway, time to get back on that grind</h5>
<p>Peace out!</p>
